    <p>"what do you do for procastinating? - I browse clothes online." That's what I heard from a fellow colleague at uni (Dundee) and thought that I could do something to improve her procastination time, and make it actually good for her and for e-commerces that she liked.</p>

    <p>no bullshit. no complicated stuff. Just add what you want, and find it later whenever you want to buy it.</p>

    <p>At Totely, I am responsible for the design and, my boyfriend, Nikolas for the development of the web app. We both are Totely co-founders.</p>
