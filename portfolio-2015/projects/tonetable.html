        <p>I worked in this project as a research assistant.This project was leaded by Graham Pullin (ex-IDEO studio head of design in London) who is now a researcher and professor at University of Dundee, in partnership with Shannon Hennig (AAC researcher in Australia).</p>

        <h3>Research - Examining and Understanding</h3>
        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>Since Graham had previous projects that were in the same field, he has wide knowledge about the users. So, with this documentation we started building the scenarios. We brainstormed and made two possible cases. The first one, was a product that worked as a SGD, which you could choose the tone of voice with cards. The second one, was a book that was about experimentation, but less than the card one, because with the book you should follow some lessons and interact with it to get the tones of voice.</p>

        <h4>Talk with AAC Researcher</h4>
        <p>Then, Graham and I had a video call with Shannon Hennig, who works in Australia as a language Therapist and researcher, and she could help us with thoughts on both scenarios.</p>

        <p>First thing was that she was impressed with the way we presented the work to her: with a scenario. She said that usually people bring pieces of text, and the visual approach surprised and engaged her.</p> 

        <p>Her thoughts were fundamental for our work, and acted as a north star to help us find the best solution.</p>

        <h4>Search from Inspiration</h4>
        <p>After gathering lots of information from both Graham and Shennon, it was time to step back and look for some visual inspiration as well.

        <p>This is one of my favourite stages of the design process, because it is where your eyes shine as soon as you find something that somehow inspire your work, even if it is not closely related.</p>

        <p>We created a board on Pinterest to register this finding and keep remembering of them.</p>

        <p>*Offline inspiration*: we went to Tayside Recycling Centre and it was AWESOME, omg, so many old things - I suggest every designer do this one hour or another.</p>

        <p>One inspiration that stick in our heads for so many good reasons was Dieter Rams. He has of course great good design practices etc, but his kind of work somehow was related with ours. In the sense that we had an piece of product design, that was about "sound". It takes some cues from the design language of Braun––hardly an original source, but appropriate in this case as we try to balance attractiveness with a sense of scientific rigour.</p>


        <h3>Sketches - Ideation</h3>
        <h4>Sketches</h4>
        <p>So many inputs we had, so it was time to actually make things and nothing better to start than sketches. I brainstormed some ideias and drew them on paper to present it. Some of them were better than others, some took a very different approch (one of them was inspired by Scrabble game). Then, after discussing them with Graham, I took the lead to make the first prototyping iterations with cardboard! yes!</p>

        <h3>Prototype - Experimenting</h3>
        <h4>Cardboard Prototypes</h4>
        <p>After we discuss which prototype were more prominent in terms of form, we chose one and made this one work. There is no point on having a prototype if you can't use it, so there we go wiring some arduino and MP3 shields and code some stuff in order to make it actually work. It was great. In this phase, I got some audio from the Cereproc project (from Edinburgh) so I could test and pretend there were more tones of voice. Everything we produced we shared with our Australia partner via hangouts and emails.</p>

        <h4>Foam prototype</h4>
        <p>After we discuss lots of aspects from the product we chose, we decided to build a foam prototype (not the blue one, but orange!)</p>

        <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
        <p>I had so many difficulties in this part - but they were fun difficulties. How come? Laser-cutting, adjusting the machine, coding details - all of this stuff took so much time, but I was really enjoying this, since I came from a digital-only background. That was my chance to learn something new and awesome.</p>
